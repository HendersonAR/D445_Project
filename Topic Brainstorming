Post the topics you are brainstorming for the project here. Try to include datasets if possible. You may also vote on the ones you like with a '*' and vote for your favorite choice with '**'

Emily's brainstorming section:
URL to search for specific datasets, great for searching across thousands of reprositories = https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/ 
URL (reddit forum) where people reccomend different free data sources = https://www.reddit.com/r/tableau/comments/18w8yil/where_do_you_guys_find_datasets/
URL to WHO datasets on health = https://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.home
URL to bird datasets = https://data.world/datasets/birds
URL for bird datasets by species = https://avibase.bsc-eoc.org/avibase.jsp?lang=EN#:~:text=Avibase%20is%20an%20extensive%20database,in%20several%20languages%20and%20more.
URL for US bird datasets = https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/?tags=birds
*Idea 1: Statistically finding the best wordle start word 
*Idea 2: Seeing if there's a correlation to the introduction of invasive starlings and population of native wood peckers (I love birds)
*Idea 3: Volcanoes (this is a very vague idea... I just like volcanoes. I also feel like it'd be easy to find a dataset with binary variables)
*Idea 4: Looking at the population of a specific insect and see if there's correlations with native/invasive plants
Idea 5: Something with maternal pregnancy... maybe comparing the maternal/infantal death rate in countries with strict abortion laws, countries that have higher trends of religion, countries with different types of health systems?

Nick's Ideas:
*1. Using characteristics to predict the market value for trading cards
2. Using patterns in social media to predict responses to events or determining bot activity
*3. With more EV alternatives on the road, can we predict the future of the SPIN scooters? Are we phasing out of leaving orange scooters on the sidewalk or are they here to stay?
4. can we predict trending meme patterns 
*5. Forecast the lifespan of urban trees based on species, location, and environmental factors and predict which areas of a city are most at risk of losing tree cover
*6. Evaluate the impact of increased CSU student capacity and stress on local road infrastructure, and form a prediction on how inccreased student size affects cars on the roads/accidents/other categories
7. Make predictions on how much new cooking technologies reduces cooking/prep time.
*8. Examine characteristics of trending books to form predictions on success of new upcoming titles/genres.
*9. Use language learning apps to make predictions on popular languages.
*10. Estimate the likely success of a song title to reach high in the bilboards based on the current trends.
*11. Colorado Wolves were introduced back into the states a few years ago. Can we use the data collected to make any predictions on the success of this species reintroduction program?
*12. Use civil planning data to predict local urban redevelopment/expansion in Fort Collins or surrounding towns.
*13. Estimate evacuation compliance rates during natural disasters over the last few years to predict the effectiveness of early warning systems/disaster response
*14. Is CSU parking at capacity? With the student enrollment increasing each year can we predict when CSU parking will be completely full? Can we determine how many more parking spaces they might need to comfortably accomodate parking at CSU?
