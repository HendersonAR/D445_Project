Post the topics you are brainstorming for the project here. Try to include datasets if possible. You may also vote on the ones you like with a '*' and vote for your favorite choice with '**'

Emily's brainstorming section:
URL to search for specific data sets = https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/ 
WHO datasets on health = https://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.home
Idea 1: Statistically finding the best wordle start word
Idea 2: Seeing if there's a correlation to the introduction of invasive starlings and population of native wood peckers (I love birds)
Idea 3: Volcanoes (this is a very vague idea... I just like volcanoes. I also feel like it'd be easy to find a dataset with binary variables)
Idea 4: Looking at the population of a specific insect and see if there's correlations with native/invasive plants
Idea 5: Something with maternal pregnancy... maybe comparing the maternal death rate in countries with strict abortion laws, countries that have higher trends of religion, countries with different types of health systems?
