Emily's brainstorming section:
URL to search for specific datasets, great for searching across thousands of reprositories = https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/ 
URL (reddit forum) where people reccomend different free data sources = https://www.reddit.com/r/tableau/comments/18w8yil/where_do_you_guys_find_datasets/
URL to WHO datasets on health = https://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.home
URL to bird datasets = https://data.world/datasets/birds
URL for bird datasets by species = https://avibase.bsc-eoc.org/avibase.jsp?lang=EN#:~:text=Avibase%20is%20an%20extensive%20database,in%20several%20languages%20and%20more.
URL for US bird datasets = https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/?tags=birds
Idea 1: Statistically finding the best wordle start word 
Idea 2: Seeing if there's a correlation to the introduction of invasive starlings and population of native wood peckers (I love birds)
Idea 3: Volcanoes (this is a very vague idea... I just like volcanoes. I also feel like it'd be easy to find a dataset with binary variables)
Idea 4: Looking at the population of a specific insect and see if there's correlations with native/invasive plants
Idea 5: Something with maternal pregnancy... maybe comparing the maternal/infantal death rate in countries with strict abortion laws, countries that have higher trends of religion, countries with different types of health systems?
