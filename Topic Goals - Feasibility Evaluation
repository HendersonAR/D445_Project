(Edit as needed) After the meeting today we have decided on pursuing the following topics:
1. Spin scooter trend predictions
2. Volcanoes
3. Aquifer table
4. Anything with a map

Our goal here is to cumulate the data sets needed to make the suitable predictions. 
The order is from top to lowest priority. 
If we find the top priority will not form a feasable project, let's switch to the next highest priority

Predictions:
Do more EV on the road mean less Spin scooters moving around/active riding time per year?
Do observations like time of day, day of week, or starting location, predict drop-off/abandonment locations for these scooters?
Is price a measurable predictor for average riding time?
Can we predict when a scooter is at its highest risk for abandonment(dropped off at an unverified or undesirable location)?


Potential Hypothesis testing for our project:
Main:
H0: there is no impact on the number of electic vehicles and the usage of Spin scooters over time. Ha: there is an effect

Optional:
